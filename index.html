		<h1>Developer Portfolio</h1>
		<p>My journey into tech began when I stayed with my older brother for a summer before the end of my A-levels. As well as having a lot of fun and gaming I cast my eyes about his home office and spied some programming texts that I found intriguing. As I remember, one was Perl and the other Java. I didn't suddenly burst into action at this point like I would if this were a film, rather more of a slow burning interest and curiosity that swayed my Degree course decisions later on.</p>
		
		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<p>Since University I have worked in a variety of companies where my main area of focus has been:
			<ul>
				<li>Embedded systems programming</li>
				<li>Technical Author</li>
				<li>XML Parsing with XSLT</li>
				<li>Documentation Creation and Tools</li>
				<li>CMS Development</li>
				<li>Website Development</li>
			</ul>
		<p>This has been a bit of a mixed bag as I haven't been able to focus all my attention on one area for a long period of time.</p>	
		</p>
		<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
		<p>Skills I have learnt along the way are many, though I can't claim to be an expert in any:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>C</li>
			<li>C++</li>
			<li>Doxygen markup</li>
			<li>XSLT</li>
			<li>HTML & CSS</li>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>Test Driven Development</li>
			<li>Agile methodologies</li>
			<li>Hudson</li>
			<li>Shell Scripts</li>	
			<li>Selenium</li>	
			<li>git</li>
		</ul>	
		<h2>Transferable skills</h2>
		<p>An expert in stress management and overwhelm I am now fully equipped to manage time and organise myself and others effectively. This includes trips away having to pack for most eventualitles and coping well when I didn't go as far as bringing the kitchen sink.</p> 
		
		<p>I try my hardest not to take time for granted. Time spent outside and exercising is time well spent. Even better if it's with people you love. I use my fear of time ticking away to propel myself into doing, not just planning to do.</p>

		<h2>Returning to tech</h2>
		<p>Apart from obvious financial benefits and freedom, my return to work will give me a sense of accomplishment, and feed my need for knowledge and inderstanding and I relish becoming a good role model for my children.</p>
