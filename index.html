		<h2>The Beginning</h2>
		<p>My journey into tech began when I stayed with my older brother for a summer before the end of my A-levels. As well as having a lot of fun and gaming I cast my eyes about his home office and spied some programming texts that I found intriguing. As I remember, one was Perl and the other Java. I didn't suddenly burst into action at this point like I would if this were a film, rather more of a slow burning interest and curiosity that swayed my Degree course decisions later on.</p>
